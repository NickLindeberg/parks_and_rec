## Painpoints
This was a fun project meant to show skills in Ruby, Rails, API calls and some testing around it all.  I really enjoyed the process of creating a rails 6 application from scratch.  It has been roughly 3 years since I've built a greenfield rails project to this scale (I have been focused on React lately).  Though I feel good about the final product, there are definitely things I would change, given the time/change.

My biggest issues were environmental.  I haven't spun up a rails 6 project on my personal machine before and it took a good chunk of an afternoon to get up and running.  My other issue was deploying to Heroku.  I was successful but there were many attempts to get it right.
